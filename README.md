BATTLESHIP
Here is a good way to show off your new skills: offer a friend to play a computer game that you wrote yourself! Of course, it is much more fun to play Battleship with someone else: the possibility of winning or losing adds a thrill to the game!

Both players add the ships to their fields one by one (no peeking!), and then start shelling each other until one of them succeeds. To make the game fair and prevent the players from peeping at each other's fields, after each move add the message "Press Enter and pass the move to another player", which will clear the screen.

It looks like everything is ready for full-scale battlefield maneuvers! This time, don't cease fire until all the ships are sunk. At the end of the game, your program should print a congratulatory message to the winner: You sank the last ship. You won. Congratulations!

Previous step:
To complete this step, you should add a check that all the ships were successfully sunk. The game is supposed to go on until all ships go down. The program should print an extra message You sank a ship! when all the cells of a particular ship have been hit. Take a look at the examples below!

For the sake of simplicity; the project does not consider shots to coordinates that are already shot at to be any different. Regardless of whether the coordinate was previously a hit or a miss, you should display You hit a ship! and You missed! again respectively.
